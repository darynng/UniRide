UniRide is a specialized carpooling website tailored specifically for college students, with a primary focus on connecting routes between major campuses in Ohio. A potential feature of UniRide is leveraging student IDs for identity verification and location tracking. This unique feature enhances security and ensures that rides are exclusively shared among verified college students. UniRide recognizes the financial constraints of college students and offers budget-friendly ridesharing options. Cost-sharing features and student discounts make it an economical choice for students looking to save on transportation costs. 
This is the basic prototype of the website with a map for departure and destination locations.
